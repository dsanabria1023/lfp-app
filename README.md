# LFP
LFP (Looking for Party) is an adaptive website that will allow users to create an account, set up a profile, and browse other users near their location to find people to play Dungeons and Dragons with. Initially, the app will allow of users to specify whether they are a player or a Dungeon Master and provide some information about the characters they want to play or the type of campaign they want to run. If interested, the user can then send messages to those players/Dungeon Masters and get to know a little bit more about their campaign and each other, and eventually set up sessions to play.

## Goals
My goal with LFP is to help people make more interpersonal connections through the games we play. As convenient as it may be to get a group together online to use Roll 20 or some similar technology to play, in my experience nothing beats sitting around a table with people and playing D&D together. This site will hopefully help develop those amazing moments for people and help them make some new friends along the way.

##Down the Road
Once the MVP version of LFP is completed, there are more features that I have in mind to add. Some features will make the site more convenient to use (dedicated mobile app), some will help users find exactly what they are looking for (advanced search by specific criteria), and some will help keep this community a safe and welcoming place for all users (player/GM rating, reporting system). Another future goal is to be able to support more tabletop RPGs, with special profile options specific to each game.
